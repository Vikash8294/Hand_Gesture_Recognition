# Hand Gesture Recognition

This repository is dedicated to recognizing hand gestures using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The primary language used is **Jupyter Notebook**, making it interactive and easy to experiment with.

## Features

- Detects and classifies hand gestures from images.
- Utilizes machine learning models for gesture recognition.
- Code organized and runnable in Jupyter Notebook format.
- Easily extensible for new gestures or datasets.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vikash8294/Hand_Gesture_Recognition.git
    cd Hand_Gesture_Recognition
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    - Make sure you have Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook installed.
    - Install required packages (example below, update as needed):
      ```bash
      pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib
      ```
    - You may need additional packages depending on the notebooks.

## Usage

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. **Open the relevant notebook** and follow the instructions to load your data or run tests.
3. **Modify or extend the code** to experiment with different models or data.
